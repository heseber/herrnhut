# 110-ray Herrnhut Star

The classical Herrnhut Star has 28 rays (or 27 if the top ray is replaced by a cable for the light bulb). However, there are also larger versions with more rays, e.g. 50, 62 or 110 rays. The goal of this project is to construct and visualize a 3D model of a 110-ray star and to create a construction manual for building one yourself.
